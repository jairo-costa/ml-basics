# Notes

This folder contains structured study notes that accompany the development of the projects in this repository.  
The objective is to register learning insights, daily observations, conceptual summaries, and reflections generated during the practical exercises.

Each file follows the pattern:

- **notes-dayX.md**  
- chronological organization  
- concise explanations  
- technical observations  
- references to real ML engineering practices  

These notes support learning continuity and serve as an internal knowledge base for future projects.
