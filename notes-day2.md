# Day 2 – Study Notes

## MIT – Introduction to Deep Learning (CNNs)
- Understanding that **images are numbers** was a breakthrough concept today.
- A pixel is simply a numeric value, and an image is a matrix (or tensor) of these values.
- Convolutional Neural Networks use filters (kernels) that slide over the image and extract visual patterns like edges and textures.
- This process transforms raw pixel data into meaningful representations the model can learn from.

## DeepLearning.AI – Prompt Engineering for Developers (Lesson 2)
- Instruction-Tuned LLMs rely on supervised fine-tuning and RLHF to align behavior with human expectations.
- The idea of being “helpful, honest, and harmless” connects perfectly with our conversation from yesterday.
- The course introduced code examples using the OpenAI API, reinforcing practical prompting structures.
