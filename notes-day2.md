# 📘 Day 2 — Study Notes

## 🧠 MIT — Introduction to Deep Learning (CNNs)
- Key insight of the day: **Images are numerical data.**
- Each pixel represents intensity values (grayscale or RGB channels).
- CNNs extract visual patterns by applying convolutional filters that detect edges, shapes, and textures.
- Understanding the transformation from raw pixels → feature maps → high-level representations.

## 🤖 DeepLearning.AI — Prompt Engineering for Developers (Lesson 2)
- Instruction-tuned LLMs are trained to be *helpful, honest, and harmless*.
- RLHF aligns model outputs with human expectations through preference-based training.
- Introduction to practical prompting patterns and code interactions with the OpenAI API.
- Reinforces the connection between theoretical concepts and real-world implementations.
