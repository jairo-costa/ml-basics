# ml-basics — Foundations of Machine Learning & Practical ML Projects

This repository contains foundational Machine Learning projects and study notes developed as part of my structured AI/ML learning track.  
The objective is to build a **solid, practical base** in Python, data preprocessing, classical ML algorithms, and introductory deep learning — applied through clean, reproducible, real-world notebooks.

This repository evolves continuously as I progress through my AI Engineering learning plan.

## 🎯 Objectives of This Repository

- Strengthen core ML fundamentals  
- Practice end-to-end workflows (data loading → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation)  
- Build small but meaningful ML projects for portfolio use  
- Document insights, study notes, and personal experiments  
- Create a strong foundation before moving into GenAI, RAG, and Agent-based systems

## 📂 Projects

### **Project 01 — Data Visualization & Exploration**
A practical notebook demonstrating:

- Loading and inspecting tabular datasets  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn  
- Understanding distributions, correlations, and data quality  

**Folder:** `project-01-data-visualization/`  
**Status:** Completed  
This project serves as a warm-up for ML workflows and a reference for future analyses.

### **Project 02 — CIFAR-10 Image Classifier (Deep Learning)**
A deep learning project implementing:

- CIFAR-10 dataset loading and preprocessing  
- A simple baseline CNN architecture  
- Training, validation, and test evaluation  
- Accuracy and loss curves  
- Reproducible TensorFlow pipeline  

**Folder:** `project-02-cifar10-classifier/`  
**Status:** Completed  
This project builds the bridge between classical ML and modern deep learning.
